# Weather-Predection-using-CNN-with-Interpretability
This notebook covers training CNN from scratch to classify Weather images using Mutli-class Weather Dataset. We are using Google Colab for Training Neural Network to get access to GPU for speeding up the training process.  Dataset : Multiclass weather dataset  Dataset The dataset contains following four classes  Cloudy Rainy Sunrise Sunshine(Sunny) We will be designing our own CNN architecture using Keras for Image Classification

**Interpretability**
We use LIME( Local Modeal Agnostic Explanations) for explanatining the predections of Convolution Neural Netwroks and interpreat the reliability of the results

[Jupyter Notebook]

This Notebook covers the entire process of training CNN from scratch using Keras and using LIME package for explaning the model predections on Image instances
