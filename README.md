# Weather-Predection-using-CNN-with-Interpretability
This notebook covers training Convolutin Neural network  from scratch to classify Weather images using Mutli-class Weather Dataset.
**Dataset :** 
Multiclass weather dataset  
Dataset The dataset contains following four classes  
1)Cloudy 

2)Rainy 

3)Sunrise

4)Sunshine(Sunny) 

We will be designing our own CNN architecture using Keras for Image Classification

**Interpretability**
We use LIME( Local Modeal Agnostic Explanations) for explanatining the predections of Convolution Neural Netwroks and interpret the reliability of the results

This Notebook covers the entire process of training CNN from scratch using Keras and using LIME package for explaning the model predections on Image instances

[Model](https://github.com/amitchavda17/Weather-Predection-using-CNN-with-Interpretability/tree/master/models)
This folder contains the CNN  model and weight .h5 files
I have used Google Colab to for training to increase the speed
